# JavaProjects

This is a place for me to store and share my numerous creatons in Java, that I learn in my free time.

Java24Hours is based off of a tutorial book, and guided programs made by me, that increase in complexity depending on the hour.

Within Java24Hours/src is the main code containing my programs. The hour dictates the relative ease in creation of the program (1 being easiest, 24 being hardest), and the name of the program follows.

Feel free to leave any comments and suggestions!
